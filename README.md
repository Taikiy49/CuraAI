## How to Use

Upon accessing the platform, users are prompted to input textual descriptions of their medical concerns. Optionally, users may submit relevant images for further analysis. Subsequently, users are prompted to provide their location to facilitate the identification of the nearest medical facilities or practitioners.

## Language and API Utilization

- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Flask
- Gen AI
- Google Gemini API
- Google Maps API
- Melisa API

## Display

### Textual Prompts:

Leveraging Flask for rendering AI-generated responses, and Google Maps API for spatial representation of medical facilities' locations.

## Input Data Analysis

### Textual Prompts:

- Length: Constraints set to 75 words or less per prompt.
- Variety: Accommodating a broad spectrum of medical concerns, symptoms, and requests.
- Language Analysis: Employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to discern user intent and extract pertinent medical information.

### Image Input:

- Accepting diverse image types for analysis.
- Employing image recognition and analysis techniques to glean medical insights from submitted images.

## Processing and Analysis

### Prompt Understanding:

Employing Google Gemini API's machine learning algorithms for text classification and image recognition.

### Geolocation and Mapping:

- Utilizing Melisa API data for geospatial analysis to determine the proximity of medical facilities.
- Integrating with Google Maps API to visualize the locations of nearby medical facilities.

## Output

### Message Response:

Training the AI to deliver concise yet informative responses in a friendly manner.

### Nearest Doctor/Hospital Identification:

- Calculating distances between user locations and available medical facilities using Google Maps API.
- Matching user input with the expertise of available doctors or hospitals for precise recommendations.

## Project Overview

Cura AI's core functionality revolves around empathetic interaction with users, offering therapeutic responses to their medical concerns. Leveraging extensive prompt engineering and machine learning techniques facilitated by the Gemini AI API, the platform adeptly interprets textual and visual inputs, providing tailored medical recommendations. By leveraging the rich capabilities of Python, Flask, Gemini API, Google Maps API, Folium, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Cura AI achieves seamless integration and functionality, ensuring a user-centric approach to medical assistance.
